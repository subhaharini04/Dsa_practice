# 🧠 DSA Practice in Java (IntelliJ)

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms practice repository!  
This project is a personal journey to strengthen my DSA concepts by implementing core data structures and solving related problems in **Java**, using **IntelliJ IDEA**.

---

## 📌 What's Inside?

This repository contains Java implementations and custom test cases for:

- ✅ Arrays (1D/2D, Sliding Window, Two Pointers, etc.)
- ✅ Strings (Palindromes, Anagrams, Manipulations)
- ✅ Stack (Array & LinkedList based)
- ✅ Queue  
  - Simple Queue  
  - Circular Queue (Array-based)  
  - Queue using Linked List  
  - Queue using Circular Linked List
- ✅ Deque (Upcoming)
- ✅ Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- ⏳ Trees, Graphs, and Recursion coming soon...

Each concept is implemented from scratch without using Java’s built-in collections (unless mentioned), to build core understanding.
